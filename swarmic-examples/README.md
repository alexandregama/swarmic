# Samples

This section gathers all Swarmic samples


## Current status

Swarmic is in it's early stage. For the moment we only demonstrate the following features:

* Camel integration thanks to Camel-CDI project
* Fat Jar building with the Maven Shaded plugin

Both are demonstrated in camel-metrics sample.

## Building

Before playing with samples, make sure to install `bom` and `parent` artifacts in your local maven repo by issue the following command at the root of the repo.

`mvn clean install`

You can then take a look at existing samples.
