# Examples

This section gathers all Swarmic examples


## Current status

Swarmic is in it's early stage. For the moment we only demonstrate the following features:

* Rest service (rest example)
* Camel and Metrics integration thanks to Camel-CDI and Metrics CDI projects (camel-metrics example)

Examples can be ran directly from maven or from a fat jar embedding all required dependencies.

## Building

Before playing with examples, make sure to install `bom` and `parent` artifacts in your local maven repo by issue the following command at the root of the repo.

`mvn clean install`

You can then take a look at existing examples.
